1 | Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file and show the output for test cases. Develop an interactive program by comparing the result by implementing LIST THEN ELIMINATE algorithm.
2 | For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
3 | Demonstrate preprocessing (Data Cleaning, Integration and Transformation) activity on suitable data. For example, identify and delete Rows that contain duplicate data by considering an appropriate dataset. Identify and delete columns that contain a single value by considering an appropriate dataset.
4 | Demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
5 | Demonstrate the working of the Random Forest algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
6 | Implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering a few test data sets.
7 | Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.
8 | Construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set.
9 | Demonstrate the working of EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in .CSV file.
10 | Demonstrate the working of SVM classifier for a suitable dataset.
